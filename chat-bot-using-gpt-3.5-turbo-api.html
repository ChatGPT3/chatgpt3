 <p>In this video, we'll show you how to build a chatbot using the OpenAI's Chat GPT API and Flask. We'll walk you through step by step, from setting up your Flask app to integrating with the gpt-3.5-turbo API , and displaying the chatbot conversation in a user-friendly interface.</p>
  <p>We'll cover the basics of using the new OpenAI API for Chat completion, including setting up an account and creating an API key. We'll then show you how to create a Flask app and set up a basic chatbot interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Next, we'll integrate with the OpenAI API model gpt-3.5-turbo and use it to generate responses for our chatbot. We'll show you how to handle user input, send it to the OpenAI API, and receive and display the response in our chatbot interface.</p>
  <p>We'll also cover some advanced features, including formatting the chatbot conversation to make it more user-friendly, handling errors and exceptions, and adding support for code snippets and syntax highlighting.</p>
  <p>What is a Chat Bot?</p>
  <p>A chatbot is an AI-powered computer program designed to simulate a conversation with human users, typically over the internet. Chatbots can be integrated into various platforms such as websites, messaging applications, or voice assistants, and can interact with users via text, voice, or other modalities.</p>
  <p>Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user inputs and respond appropriately. They can provide a range of services such as answering frequently asked questions, providing customer support, making recommendations, or even facilitating transactions.</p>
