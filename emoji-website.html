  <p>
    In this video, we will build a full stack web app using chat gpt. </p>
<p>We are gonna build a random emoji generator website.</p>
<p>Every time you visit this website ,it will show you a different emoji.</p>
<p>Tech stack  is HTML, CSS , Python and Flask server.</p>
<p>Then we will deploy this website to the cloud.</p>
<p>Today, we will use 'pythonanywhere'.</p>
<p>At last, this website is live and available to all of you at:</p>
    <a href="https://emoji.pythonanywhere.com">https://emoji.pythonanywhere.com</a>
  <p>
    Try building something on your own.

<h2>
  What is ChatGPT?
</h2>
<p>
  ChatGPT is a new chatbot developed by OpenAI. It is a variant of the GPT-3 model which was specially designed to generate human-like text in response to user inputs. ChatGPT is highly customizable and can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks or to generate text in a particular style or on a specific topic. Some of its abilities include content creation, writing code, and translating languages instantaneously and with high accuracy, essentially helping us do a large portion of our work.
</p>
<h2>
 Can ChatGPT replace the workforce?
</h2>
<p>
  Given the huge jump in ability as compared to the previous GPT-2 model and the complexity of problems it can handle, one question begets among everyone – can ChatGPT replace our jobs? We decided to put that to the test using one of the most quantifiable test available – passing a coding assessment. The main objective of this test is to assess the level of programming of ChatGPT against humans.
</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
It is important to note however, that the test was conducted with a LinkedIn skills assessment, and there are many other more elaborated tools out there that can be used to assess one’s programming skill level. Given that it is an MCQ test as well, little to no critical thinking is involved in the test.
</p>
<h2>
Limitations to the Assessment
</h2>
<p>
We put ChatGPT to the test by putting it through a LinkedIn Python skills assessment. The assessment consists of 15 MCQ questions on Python language syntax and concepts, each with a time limit of 90 seconds. The assessment was conducted in real time with ChatGPT processing the prompts. That is to say, the prompts were given to ChatGPT while the assessment was ongoing, and we only proceeded after ChatGPT had provided an answer. Both the questions and the answer options were keyed into the ChatGPT’s chat box in its entirety and without changes, with the occasional prompt of specifying the language to be in Python 3.5.
